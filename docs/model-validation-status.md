This document tracks the **latest recorded** full-model numerical-validation sweep and a concise
history of changes that materially altered coverage. Only the latest sweep keeps a complete
per-case ledger; older ledgers and duplicated historical failure tables are intentionally omitted.

The skeleton sweep establishes broad graph-construction coverage. The manifest contains only model
selection and execution configuration; numerical status and blocker triage live in this document and
the linked failure analysis. Numerical validation additionally
exports the converted graph, reloads its `.webnn` and Safetensors artifacts, executes both the
original ONNX model and the reloaded graph on CPU ONNX Runtime, and compares matching outputs.

Proper dynamic cache-shape support is not currently available. Validation cases use fixed
dimension overrides and execute as independent snapshots, so they do not validate a complete
prefill-to-decode loop or growing KV-cache reuse. A decode artifact that
accepts a fixed past length `N` normally produces a cache of length `N + 1`, which cannot be fed
back into that same fixed-shape artifact. Repeated decoding therefore still requires proper dynamic
cache shapes, separately specialized artifacts, or a fixed-capacity cache with an explicit position.

## Validation automation

Pull requests use `tests/models/ci-validation.json` as the required numerical-validation contract.
Linux/ORT is blocking; macOS/CoreML runs the identical set as an experimental, non-blocking job;
Windows does not run numerical validation. Membership is defined by the curated file itself and the
runner invokes it with `--selection all`. Every entry must be suitable for hosted runners and include
a full immutable Hugging Face commit revision and a lowercase SHA-256 for its primary ONNX file.
The downloader verifies that digest both after download and on cache reuse. Full-model downloads
use the standard Hugging Face cache by default so Python and Rust clients can share immutable blobs;
`O2W_ONNX_CACHE` and `O2W_CACHE_DIR/onnx` remain explicit overrides. Completion records stay
onnx2webnn-specific and do not replace the manifest digest check.

To add a required model, first confirm it passes on ORT and CoreML, then add its exact file, commit
revision, downloaded-file digest, fixed dimension overrides, and any pinned inputs to
`tests/models/ci-validation.json`. This file is hand-maintained. `scripts/generate_manifest.py` only
regenerates `tests/models/manifest.json` and must not be used to update or carry CI pins.

The `Full model validation` workflow is manually dispatched for real publisher weights.
It runs the entire generated manifest sequentially on a runner labeled `self-hosted`, `linux`,
`x64`, and `onnx2webnn-validation`. The runner must provide network access, a writable persistent
`/var/cache/onnx2webnn`, at least a 100 GiB filesystem, and approximately 32 GiB RAM.
Downloaded model sources persist; WebNN exports are temporary. Provisioning, storage checks, and
build failures are fatal. Per-model validation failures remain diagnostic: the workflow emits a
warning and uploads its complete log for 14 days. There is no scheduled or extended-tier sweep.

### Runtime dtypes and comparison tolerances

WebNN graphs are not globally limited to floating point: RustNN records integer tensors and integer
operations where their operator contracts allow them. Matrix multiplication is different. The
portable WebNN `matmul` contract accepts matching `float16` or `float32` operands, and WebNN has no
fused equivalent of ORT's `com.microsoft.MatMulNBits`.

For q4 models, the original ONNX path gives native ORT packed Uint4 weights and a fused
`MatMulNBits` node. The reloaded path restores the same packed bytes, widens them for RustNN's
temporary ORT graph, applies `dequantizeLinear`, and runs ordinary matmul in the scale dtype. The
models in this manifest use Float32 scales and activations, so their reconstructed matmuls are
Float32. Different fused/decomposed accumulation orders are mathematically equivalent but not
bit-identical.

The validator therefore uses these output tolerances:

| Output/path | Comparison |
|-------------|------------|
| Float32 without `MatMulNBits` | `1e-5 + 1e-4 * abs(reference)` |
| Float32 from a model containing q4 `MatMulNBits` | `1e-3 + 1e-3 * abs(reference)` |
| Float32 from a model containing q8 `MatMulNBits` | `2e-3 + 2e-3 * abs(reference)` |
| Float16 | `1e-3 + 1e-2 * abs(reference)` |
| Integer and boolean | Exact |

The q4 Float32 envelope is based on a complete SmolLM2 output scan whose worst normalized
difference was `9.488e-4`. The q8 envelope is selected from each source graph's
`MatMulNBits.bits` attribute; it covers the measured Qwen output delta while remaining distinct
from q4. It does not make ORT's `accuracy_level=4` equivalent to WebNN:
level 4 permits internal Int8 activation quantization, while the WebNN lowering keeps Float32
activations. Voxtral uses level 4 on all 211 `MatMulNBits` nodes and remains blocked for this reason.

## Latest recorded sweep

- Real sweep: 2026-09-22 on `fkrall/cache-backed-validation` at `a582b89` plus the uncommitted Hugging Face cache migration worktree
- RustNN: `38022044`
- ORT: repository-local Linux x64 1.29.0 build
- Manifest: `tests/models/manifest.json` (51 cases, 44 unique ONNX files)
- Execution: one validation worker; ORT may use multiple CPU threads inside a case
- Skeleton verification: 51/51 passed; the test took 81.1s (133.2s including the release build)
- Real verification: 47/51 passed in one complete cold-cache process; wall time was 10m 43.6s and peak RSS was 30.3 GiB. No case was skipped or inferred without execution.

All 51 current manifest cases were executed. A newer checkout is not considered the tested baseline
until the real sweep is rerun and this section is replaced.

```bash
ORT_DYLIB_PATH=../rustnn/target/onnxruntime/onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.29.0/lib/libonnxruntime.so.1.29.0 \
  target/release/onnx2webnn validate-models \
  --selection all --weights real --jobs 1
```

### Summary

| Weight mode | Pass | Fail | Download skipped | Result |
|-------------|-----:|-----:|-----------------:|--------|
| Real | 47 | 4 | 0 | Complete (51/51) |

Two cases exercise unsupported cross-backend execution modes: FastVLM precision-sensitive GQA/DQL
prefill and Voxtral level-4 quantized matmul. The two Chronos publisher artifacts are rejected by
native ORT before conversion comparison.

The real-weight failures, exact affected cases, current diagnosis, and suggested ownership are
tracked in [Real-weight validation failures](real-weight-validation-failures.md).

### Current failure families

| Code | Cases | Stage | Current cause / next action |
|------|------:|-------|-----------------------------|
| Q1 | 1 | Comparison | Unsupported execution semantics: Voxtral sets `MatMulNBits accuracy_level=4`, allowing native ORT to quantize activations to Int8; WebNN lowers to Float32 dequantize-plus-matmul. |
| U1 | 1 | Comparison | Unsupported strict equivalence: FastVLM prefill repeatedly quantizes attention results whose legal floating-point rounding differs between fused ORT kernels and the portable WebNN decomposition; decode passes. |
| O1 | 2 | Native ORT load | Upstream-blocked: both Chronos paths resolve to the same publisher artifact, which feeds a float ConstantOfShape result to Gather indices. |

Real totals: no export, reload, cached-interface, or native-ORT input failures; 2 native-ORT
model-load failures, 2 unsupported execution-mode mismatches, and 47 passes.

### Current case ledger

`PASS` means export, reload, both executions, and numerical comparison completed. Any other value
is the current first-blocker code from the table above.

`WebNN If split` identifies merged decoders whose runtime `use_cache_branch` condition must be
pinned because WebNN has no `If` operation. Each prefill/decode entry produces its own independent
`.webnn`/Safetensors pair. Loading both graphs concurrently may duplicate their shared weights in
RAM and VRAM. This is distinct from ordinary repeated cases that differ only in fixed dimensions.

### Current timing and storage

| Run | Cases | Wall time |
|-----|------:|---------------:|
| Real, cold standard HF cache | 51 | 10m 43.6s |

The official Rust client populated 44 completion records, one per unique ONNX file. A subsequent
offline `match=privacy-filter` run verified warm reuse of both the primary ONNX and its external-data
sidecar.

After the sweep, the standard Hugging Face cache occupied 18 GB and temporary WebNN artifacts
occupied 32 GB; 122 GiB remained free. No selected case was skipped for download or storage.

### Current repair order

1. Track WebNN/backend capabilities that could make U1 or Q1 executable with comparable fused precision semantics.
2. Monitor the upstream Chronos repository for corrected reference exports.

## Coverage change history

This history records only changes that explain coverage movement or establish that an apparent
movement was not a functional improvement. Detailed obsolete ledgers are available through Git.

| Date / tested revisions | Change | Comparable coverage effect |
|-------------------------|--------|----------------------------|
| 2026-09-17 — validation-tier cleanup after `25ea94c` | Removed manifest validation tiers and the hand-added FP32 RoFormer smoke case, restoring the generator-owned upstream population. Status and blocker ownership now live only in these validation documents; the CLI selects `all` or `match=<text>`. | Population changed **52 → 51** by removing one passing duplicate-model variant. Comparable coverage is unchanged: skeleton **51/51** and real validation **47/51** with the same four blockers. |
| 2026-09-17 — onnx2webnn `25ea94c`, RustNN `28fb3bbe`, post-rebase complete rerun | Rebased both feature stacks onto `rustnn/onnx2webnn:main` and `rustnn/rustnn:main`, then ran all 52 skeleton cases and all 52 real-weight cases from warm caches, including heavy entries. | No regression: skeleton remained **52/52**; real validation remained **48/52** with the identical FastVLM U1, Voxtral Q1, and two Chronos O1 blockers. |
| 2026-09-17 — onnx2webnn `d4d350b`, RustNN `724d076b`, targeted FastVLM probes | Exposed layer boundaries and compared ORT CPU flash/non-flash GQA against the WebNN decomposition. Layer 0 and external rotary matched; the first failing boundary followed layer-1 GQA dynamic quantization and output projection. Native ORT first-logit output changed from `0.669124` to `1.066261` when only its GQA kernel changed, while WebNN remained `1.211192`. | Reclassified FastVLM prefill from generic N1 to unsupported U1. Coverage remains **48/52**; no tolerance was weakened. |
| 2026-09-17 — onnx2webnn `6f6ad8a` plus current Cast/Slice/comparison worktree, RustNN `65e76e67` plus Slice-backend worktree | Normalized ONNX numeric-to-Bool Cast through comparison, preserved positive Slice strides with WebNN extent semantics, and selected q4/q8 comparison envelopes from `MatMulNBits.bits`. | DETR, Donut encoder, and Qwen passed; real coverage rose **45 → 48** on the same 52 cases. FastVLM prefill, Voxtral level 4, and the two invalid Chronos artifacts remain blocked. |
| 2026-09-16 — onnx2webnn `24fdd50` plus current validator/manifest worktree, RustNN `7f07a5e1` plus packed-4-bit archive worktree | Measured complete q4 output error distributions and applied a `1e-3` absolute/relative Float32 envelope only to source graphs containing `MatMulNBits`. Classified Voxtral's `accuracy_level=4` Int8-activation execution mode as unsupported. | SmolLM2 prefill/decode and Janus passed; Voxtral remained Q1. Real passes rose **42 → 45** on the same 52 cases. |
| 2026-09-16 — onnx2webnn `24fdd50` plus current manifest/tests worktree, RustNN `7f07a5e1` plus packed-4-bit archive worktree | Stored packed Int4/Uint4 constants as versioned U8 Safetensors payloads while preserving logical dtype and shape in `.webnn`, then restored and executed them on reload. Marked the identical invalid Chronos publisher artifacts as upstream-blocked. | E1 was eliminated from the real sweep: all four q4 cases reached comparison and exposed N1. The aggregate remained **42/52** because those cases do not yet match numerically. |
| 2026-09-15 — onnx2webnn `ec5ba275` plus current validator worktree, RustNN `7f07a5e1` | Reconciled native ONNX interfaces with branch-specialized cached WebNN interfaces, dispatching only retained inputs and accepting omitted outputs only when native ORT proves they are empty. | Real passes rose **32 → 42** on the same 52 cases. All ten V1 cases passed numerically and no new blocker family appeared. |
| 2026-09-14 — onnx2webnn `aaa33e2` plus current validator worktree, RustNN `7f07a5e1` | Made standard `token_type_ids` zero, `attention_mask` one, and preserved zero-element input buffers without treating scalars as empty. | Real passes rose **28 → 32** on the same 52 cases. I1-I3 were eliminated: four cases passed, five exposed V1, and two exposed N1. |
| 2026-09-12 — onnx2webnn `4926c3e`, RustNN `7f07a5e1` | RustNN `2e22b3db` unified MLGraphBuilder recording and GraphJSON loader inference, replacing the loader-only string-based inference loop. Typed inference added the previously missing/rejected Resample2d, RoundEven/Clamp, Conv2d, LogicalNot, and LogicalAnd reload paths. | On the same 52-case manifest, real passes rose **6 → 28**. Former reload families R1–R5 were eliminated; newly reachable cases exposed N1 and V1 instead. |
| 2026-09-12 — RustNN `7f07a5e1` | Made `[]` unambiguously scalar and required completed GraphInfo descriptors to have known shapes. | Hardened the shared inference path but did not itself add the dispatch that cleared R1–R5; no separate coverage gain is attributed without a bisect. |
| 2026-09-09 — onnx2webnn `e5a5f88c`, RustNN `2783a191` | Rebased onto the newer upstream model manifest and converter work. The manifest changed from 63 to 52 cases: 21 retained, 31 added, 42 removed. | Retained cases preserved their outcomes. Real coverage changed to 6 passes because the population changed, not because comparable coverage improved. One real Voxtral download was skipped. |
| 2026-09-08/09 — onnx2webnn `f1ca548`, RustNN `b64cf495` | First complete real-weight full-model baseline with cache-backed export, reload, deterministic execution, and comparison. | 7/63 real cases passed. Every case that reached comparison matched; failures established the original reload, serialization, and input blocker families. |

### RustNN inference-refactor attribution

RustNN `2e22b3db` removed the separate ten-pass GraphJSON shape-inference implementation. Both
normal graph construction and GraphJSON loading now pass typed operations through
`GraphRecorder::record_operation` and `infer_operation_descriptors`. This directly removed:

- R1: missing Resample2d output-shape inference.
- R2: inconsistent RoundEven spelling and missing Clamp inference.
- R3: missing Conv2d output-shape inference.
- R4: inconsistent LogicalNot spelling.
- R5: inconsistent LogicalAnd spelling.

The full manifest was tested at `7f07a5e1`, not bisected at `2e22b3db`; attribution is based on
the code changes between the recorded revisions. A focused reload benchmark found the changed
graph reconstruction/inference stage about 6% faster on seven cached graphs, while end-to-end
weight-heavy loading was effectively unchanged.

## Maintenance rule

When a new complete sweep is recorded:

1. Replace the latest metadata, summary, failure counts, timing, and the **single** case ledger.
2. Add one concise history row only when a code/revision change explains coverage movement.
3. Do not append another historical case ledger or duplicate obsolete failure-family tables.
4. Distinguish manifest/population changes from improvements on comparable cases.
